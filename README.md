A current ongoing project by Keelan Jonathan.
Enter a location name into the input field and get the current
weather, in addition to a forcast for the next couple of days.

# Built with

HTML, CSS, SASS, Vanilla JavaScript.

# API

- Google Geocoding API
  Utilised to convert place names into longitude and latitude co-ordinates, that can then be used in the Weather App API as parameters for the weather data query.

- Open Weather App API
  Utilised to obtain live weather data for locations around the world, based on longitude and latitude co-ordinates.

Please note: This app requires an API key from Open Weather App to function. You can visit https://openweathermap.org/api and create a free acount to obtain one.

With your Api key at hand, you'll need to update the api
variable within app.js line 22, with your personal Api key.
